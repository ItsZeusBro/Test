//What is a perfect recurrance?
//Infinite recursion (which is not necessarily a circle but can be averaged as a circle)

//what is a minimal spiral that approaches pure recurrance?
//A repetition of the original pattern with an off by one in any given direction
//So aababcabcd... or aazazyazyx...etc 
//the direction of the off by one value in for a discrete step represents the direction of the spiral

//That is the most extreme theoretical case and the foundation for recurrent pattern analysis

//when fitting a spiral we are trying to fit the largest possible spiral for the data
//or in the alternative the mean spiral between the largest and the smallest
