# Fluff
Functions that help general testing and quality assurance needs, or anything else.

Current Generative Testing Strategy:
1. We are looking for a formal language or schema that describes what a function should do before writing it which would create the test cases for us and the test data needed for the test cases.

Future AI Quality Assurance Strategy:
1. Write test cases using Fluff tools
2. Use AI on test cases to generate new test cases
3. Run generated test cases
4. Formalize function you are testing using AI (reversing the test cases into a working function)
5. Use formalization against improvements of original function
6. iterate
