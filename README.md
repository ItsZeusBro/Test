# Test
Functions that help general testing needs. For the future this has larger ambitions with AI

Future AI Quality Assurance Strategy:
1. Write test cases using Test tools
2. Use AI on test cases to generate new test cases
3. Run generated test cases
4. Formalize function you are testing using AI (reversing the test cases into a working function)
5. Use formalization against improvements of original function
6. iterate
